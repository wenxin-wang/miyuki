#+TITLE: miyuki is my wiki manager

`miyuki` helps me manage and search through multiple wiki
repositories, providing a merged view of them.

Currently, each wiki is a directory of flat files, with no hierarchy;
and `miyuki` is just a wrapper around `ag`, `wget`, and other common
unix unitilites.

The name Miyuki takes credit from a character in the manga/anime [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Star_(manga)][Lucky
Star]], who was given the nickname "miwiki" by fans.
